<p>VS Code has an integrated terminal that runs under the xterm.js. When I start to type many common diacritics and accent marks <a href="https://xtermjs.org/">xterm.js</a> ignores the modifier key. So I can‚Äôt use that special character.<br />
The funny thing is that everything is working as expected with Yakuake (Plasma/KDE) and PHPStorm‚Äôs terminal.<br />
